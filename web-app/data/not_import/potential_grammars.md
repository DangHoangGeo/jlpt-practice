～たりとも (~ない) – “(not) even ~.” Emphasizes not even the smallest unit. 一瞬たりとも気が抜けない – “I cannot relax for even a second.” This pattern combines with counters (一日たりとも, 一円たりとも) to stress a minimal degree

～いかんにかかわらず / ～いかんによらず – “Regardless of ~.” A formal phrase meaning “without depending on X” (X=次第で in meaning)

. E.g. 結果の如何にかかわらず、努力を称賛します – “Regardless of the result, I applaud your effort.” “如何(いかん)” is an old word for “how/what,” used in set phrases like this and often tested for reading and meaning in formal texts. (Similar to 〜を問わず.)

. Commonly with verbs like 願う, 愛する, 尊敬する: 皆様の幸せを願ってやみません – “I wish for everyone’s happiness from the bottom of my heart (unceasingly).” The test might give a sentence where only てやまない fits to convey deep emotion.
～をおいて他にない – “No ... other than ~; ~ is the only.” 彼をおいてリーダーに適任な人はいない – “Aside from him, there’s no one else fit to be leader (he is the only one)”. This pattern is used to single out something/someone as unique. It challenges learners to spot a somewhat long phrase that functions like “only X can do this.”
～極まりない – “Extremely ~; nothing more ~ than this.” Often used with negative adjectives in written form: 失礼極まりない – “extremely rude (to the utmost level)” or 遺憾極まりない – “absolutely regrettable.” It intensifies an adjective to the highest degree
