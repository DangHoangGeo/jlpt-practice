Phrases (10 Idiomatic Expressions)
These idioms and set phrases often appear in N1 vocabulary questions (especially “言い換え類義” or “文脈規定” questions) to test whether you know figurative meanings. Each is given with its literal components and actual meaning:
頭を抱える (atama o kakaeru) – “to hold one’s head (in one’s hands).” Meaning: to be at wits’ end or deeply troubled by a problem. Often used when someone is stuck or overwhelmed by a difficult issue. (Literally envision someone with head in hands out of worry.) This idiom is used to challenge understanding of metaphors for being distressed.
肩を並べる (kata o naraberu) – “to line up shoulders.” Meaning: to be on par with; to rank alongside as an equal. For example, 世界の一流企業と肩を並べる – “to stand shoulder to shoulder with the world’s top companies (as an equal competitor).” A phrase indicating equality or matching someone great in status or ability.
目処が立つ (medo ga tatsu) – “a prospect stands.” Meaning: to have prospects of success or resolution in sight. 解決の目処が立った – “A solution is now in sight.” This phrase is often tested since 目処 is tricky (written with “eye” and old kanji for “throne” – 目処/目途) and the whole expression means to foresee the outcome.
拍車をかける (hakusha o kakeru) – “to put spurs (on a horse).” Meaning: to spur something on; to accelerate a trend or process
. E.g. インフレに拍車をかける – “to put spurs to inflation,” i.e. further accelerate inflation. Recognize this as intensifying or adding momentum to an ongoing situation.
一目置く (ichimoku oku) – “to place one object (one eye) down.” Meaning: to acknowledge someone’s superiority; to defer to someone’s expertise. 彼には一目置いている – “I recognize his ability (and hold him in respect).” Often used when even experts concede esteem to another person. This idiom is a favorite for testing because it doesn’t literally relate to “eyes” or “placing” in meaning.
口を挟む (kuchi o hasamu) – “to insert a mouth.” Meaning: to interrupt or cut into a conversation. 人の話に口を挟まないでください – “Please don’t butt in on others’ conversations.” Common idiom for interjecting, often tested among other “speaking” phrases.
耳を疑う (mimi o utagau) – “to doubt one’s ears.” Meaning: to be unable to believe what you hear (because it’s shocking or surprising). 彼が犯人だなんて、耳を疑った – “I couldn’t believe my ears that he was the culprit.” Recognize this as an idiom expressing shock at information.
一筋縄ではいかない (hito suji nawa de wa ikanai) – “won’t go by a single rope.” Meaning: not straightforward, not dealt with by ordinary means. Describes a difficult person or problem that can’t be handled with simple methods. 彼女は一筋縄ではいかない – “She is not an easy person to deal with.” A classic idiom to denote complexity or stubborn difficulty.
途方に暮れる (tohō ni kureru) – “to be lost in the way/road.” Meaning: to be at a loss, not know what to do next. 仕事を失い途方に暮れている – “Having lost my job, I’m at a complete loss.” This phrase often appears in reading passages to describe a protagonist’s despair or confusion, testing if you understand the sense of helplessness conveyed.
お手上げ (oteage) – “hands up (in surrender).” Meaning: being stuck with no solutions; giving up. もう何をしても直せないなんて、本当にお手上げだ – “If it really can’t be fixed, then I’m completely done for (out of options).” This colloquial phrase (literally “raising hands”) indicates total surrender to a difficult situation. It’s often included to see if you know idioms for “defeat” or “no hope.”
(Each of the above phrases is commonly used to stump test-takers by requiring knowledge beyond direct translations. Be sure to learn the context in which each idiom is used.)
